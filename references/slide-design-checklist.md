# Slide Design Checklist

## Palette and Theme
- Use one dominant color for most surfaces and shape fills.
- Use one or two supporting colors for structure and grouping.
- Use one accent color for highlights only.
- Keep color behavior consistent on every slide.

## Typography
- Use one header font + one body font pair.
- Title size 36-44 pt.
- Body size 14-16 pt.
- Caption/label size 11-13 pt.
- Avoid more than three font sizes on a single slide unless needed for charts.

## Layout and Visuals
- Every slide includes at least one visual element:
  - image, icon set, chart, timeline, or diagram.
- Avoid dense text blocks.
- Rotate layouts to avoid monotony:
  - two-column,
  - 2x2 grid,
  - half-bleed image,
  - comparison split.
- Maintain consistent alignment and margins across all slides.

## Content Quality
- One message per slide.
- Prefer action-oriented slide titles.
- Keep bullets concise and parallel in structure.
- Label visuals directly so the takeaway is obvious.

## QA Pass
1. Run a full slide-by-slide review.
2. Fix contrast, overflow, and alignment issues.
3. Confirm motif consistency.
4. Confirm all sections in the outline are represented.
5. Perform a final pass for visual rhythm and polish.
